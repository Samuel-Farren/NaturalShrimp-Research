# NaturalShrimp-Research
A repo focusing on projections and research for NaturalShrimp-Inc. This is not affiliated with anyone working for the company, I am simply an investor with interest.

Hello my fellow SHMPers, this is a very lengthy post, and aimed toward any math people out and about, but I went down a rabbit hole over the past couple days doing a lot of research into Shrimp growth rates and all of the variables that come into play when it comes to growing and harvesting shrimpers. I’ve seen a lot of people post metrics and estimates to how much they think SHMP will be able produce given their current facilities and water capacity, so that got me thinking. Below is what I have aggregated from various scientific journals, seafood articles, and academic studies with regards to Shrimpies, specifically Pacific White Shrimp, or for the fancy people among us: Litopenaeus vannamei. The point of this post is to understand what variables come into play with what affects shrimp growth rates, and in turn, using this understanding to possibly predict capacity outputs of NaturalShrimp, and how it may change in the future. In addition, I came across some interesting ideas with regards to shrimp genetics and how they may play a crucial part in future SHMP facility outputs. I would like to preface this with the fact that I am nothing but a 25 year old paycheck-to-paycheck-investing-millennial who has 0 aquaculture experience. I am just a fellow shrimper with an engineering degree who has been investing in SHMP since late 2018 because I believed they would disrupt a 200 billion dollar industry with their technology and water chemistry based approach to Aquaculture. I would encourage any input in the comments below to anything you think may be wrong or miscalculated.

**TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read/Summary):**

They are doing everything right for expansion and for maximizing their profit opportunity. The key components that go into determining weekly harvest outputs given a certain amount of tank capacity boils down to a couple key parameters: Growth Rate of the shrimp, Stocking Density of the shrimp, and survival rate of the shrimp. Varying these parameters one can deduce how many pounds NS can produce in a week. See Table 2 below. In addition, genetics can play a key role in the growth rate of Shrimp, where shrimp with optimal genetics can experience growth rates of up to 2.5 grams per week, where the average for a bioflac farm is 1 gram per week. In Summary, I like the Stock.

**Dirty Details:**

Before we get started, I would like to introduce some commonly used terminology that are frequently used in Shrimp studies:

**Definitions:**

**PL:** Post Larvae Shrimp (A baby shrimp)

**PL-8:** A baby shrimp that is 8 days old

**PL-10:** A baby shrimp that is 10 days old. This is the size shrimp NaturalShrimp said they buy from their supplier when they stock them in the nursery

**PL-X:** A baby shrimp that is X days old

**RAS:** Recirculating Aquaculture System

**1 Pound** = 453 grams

**18-22 Size Shrimp**: It takes 18-22 shrimp to make a pound. 22 shrimp weighing at 20 grams a piece would be 440 grams, right at about 453 grams, the weight needed to make a pound, so for the sake of making the math easier below, we will assume at a weight of 20 grams, the shrimp will be harvested. In the real world, you will probably have shrimp after harvest that are 20 grams, some that are 21 grams, some that are 22 grams etc, That 18-22 is given just as a range for how many shrimp are needed on average. Don’t take this out of context by saying “Oh but what if I give you one shrimp that is massive at 430 grams, and then 20 other shrimp that are really small at 1 gram each. iSNt tHaT sTiLL 18-22 sIzE SHrImPppppp?” - No, go away troll

**26-30 Size Shrimp:** It takes 26-30 shrimp to make a pound. 28 shrimp weighing at 16 grams a piece would be 448 grams, right at about 453 grams (The weight needed to make a pound)

**Stocking Density:** This is the density at which shrimp are stocked in the grow out tanks. Think of this as, “if I randomly scooped out 1 gallon of water, on average how many shrimp would be swimming around in that gallon of water.” However, it should be noted stocking density is typically thought of in cubic meters. 1 cubic meter is equal to 264 gallons of water. So in the case of NaturalShrimp, A 10,000 gallon tank is equal to 37.85 cubic meters. So if i refer to a stocking density of 500 shrimp/ cubic meter, that means on average, if you randomly pull out 264 gallons of water (or one cubic meter), there will be 500 shrimp swimming around in there.

Note: Nursery stocking density and Grow out stocking density are different since shrimp are smaller in the nursery tank, the same amount of water can support more smaller shrimp than larger shrimp.

A**verage Stocking Density**: Typical Commercial Bioflac systems and ponds stock shrimp at a density of around 450 shrimp per cubic meter. \[2\]

**NaturalShrimp Stocking Density**: This is still not verified yet, however based off past filings and other articles written, some have alluded to stocking densities in upwards of 800/cubic meter, this was specifically referenced in a seeking alpha article about Lot 180 \[3\] (Pre-Fire). However, I would assume Tom Untermeyer and team have loads of data about different tests they have done, with growth rates associated with each stocking density. I would assume they have pushed the limits of what their Electrocoagulation system can support. I would not be surprised if they went into the thousands per cubic meter. Most studies I looked at showed slower growth rates when stocking density increased, again though, we aren’t dealing with normal cicumstances, this is Electrocoagulation we are talking about. We won’t know the true answer until the first harvest, when we can extrapolate based off the total poundage of the harvest, or they release a data sheet. We know however, that the density will definitely be more than what bioflac and other methods allow.

**Growth Rate:** The rate at which a shrimp grows, based off the shrimps weight at each day or week interval. Growth rates of young shrimp are faster than matured shrimp. Young shrimp, below a weight of around 3-4 grams, grow at an exponential rate \[4\], one study showing around 10% bodyweight increase per day \[1\]. Once they hit a weight of 3-4 grams, the growth becomes linear, with an average weight increase of around 1 gram per week, and a maximum of 2.5 grams per week given optimal genetic breeding factors. I will get into a point about genetics later towards the end of the article and what I think NaturalShrimp may be doing with this.

**Okay man just shut up and stop rambling, get to the point…**

**Not yet, there is still more background:**

**Problem Setup:**

In order to apply this in the real world, we should use an example with NaturalShrimps facility. The **main** facility in Webster City Iowa has 240 10,000 gallon tanks. One outstanding question in my mind here is that at the LaCoste facility, They use 1 Nursery tank for every 2, 20,000 gallon grow out tanks, or another way of thinking about this is 1 nursery tank to 40,000 gallons of capacity. The nursery tanks sit right next to the grow out tanks and gravity flow into the grow out tanks when the PLs from the nursery are big enough. So, if that same methodology is carried over to webster city, then they may choose to build nursery tanks next to those 240 10,000 gallon grow out tanks, so if you keep the same ratio of la coste of 1 nursery to 40,000 gallons, then at webster city we have 1 nursery to 4 10,000 gallon grow out tanks. This yields 60 self contained smaller systems where one smaller system comprises of 1 nursery and 4 10,000 gallon grow out tanks.

Now, the question in my mind that one should try to figure out is, given 60 of these subsystems, how do you utilize these 60 subsystems to produce weekly harvests that maximize the capacity of water in the system. We know the typical lifecycle length of 18-22 per pound shrimp, growing from PL10 to 20 grams, takes anywhere from 20-24 weeks. However, one should note this 20-24 week timeframe includes time in the nursery and in the grow out tanks. So this poses two more questions to answer:

A. How long does it take a PL10 shrimp to grow into a big enough size to move into the    Grow out tank

B. How long does it take the shrimp to reach 20 grams (18-22) size once they hit the    grow out tank

Consider the Variables and Equation below;

T: Total time to grow from PL10 to 20 Grams

N: Total time to grow from PL10 in Nursery to big enough size to be transferred to Grow out tank

G: Total time spent in Grow out tank to reach harvestable size of 20 grams

Total Time =Nursery Time + Grow out Time

There is a time constraint here one needs to figure out. If it takes N weeks for the PLs in the Nursery to grow to a big enough size to be transferred to the grow out tanks, then the time in the grow out tanks is simply G=T-N, and one needs to figure out, how do you partition your 60 subsystems to yield weekly harvests such that there is no overlap and you don’t skip any weeks. You need to find the optimal split such that a rolling stocking of shrimp is smooth and grow out tanks are always being utilized, meaning a grow out tank is never empty. To answer, you need to know how long shrimp are in each stage of the production cycle. As an example, If it takes shrimp 5 weeks in the nursery tank, and 15 weeks in the grow out tank, then you would stock the nursery tank 5 weeks before the harvest of the grow out tank such that timing works out perfectly. Right when the grow out tank is gravity flowed into the harvest tank, you transfer the nursery tank to the grow out tank that was just released into the harvest tank. You would also then make sure all grow out tanks are stocked and harvested within 15 weeks of all other grow out tanks. So instead of viewing it as 60 subsystems, if you now partition those 60 systems into a divisible number of 15 (since 15 weeks are needed for shrimp to grow to harvest size in the grow out tanks) to maximize capacity, each section of 4 subsystems gets its own week when it will harvest. So you are harvesting 4 subsystems each week, which amounts to 4 \*4 10000 gallon tanks or 160000 gallons of capacity or 605 cubic meters. Your harvest amount will now depend on what your stocking density was and your survivability. So for the sake of example, let’s use an easy number like 1000 shrimp per cubic meter (double the typical bioflac system). That’s 605,000 shrimp stocked, and let’s say a 95% survivability, which yields about 575,000 shrimp. If each shrimp is on average 20 grams a piece this equates to around 25,000 pounds of shrimp per week. But again, we don’t know a lot of these parameters. It could be 99% survivability, it could be 600 shrimp per cubic meter density, or 1500 shrimp per cubic meter density there are a lot of unknowns.

**Research To Determine How long Shrimp will stay in Nursery Tank before being transferred:**

A study was done utilizing a Bioflac Shrimp RAS system where they tracked the growth rate of PL8 babies through 32 days of growth, PL40 at the end of the study. The PL8s averaged a weight of around 75 mg when stocked and reached about 1.6 grams after 32 days, around a 10% increase in body weight per day. We know SHMP gets PL10s, and based off the weight of PL8, with a 10% weight increase per day, a PL10 will be around 100 mg when stocked at a SHMP facility. Referencing another study from Purdue \[2\], they said nursery shrimp are typically transferred to grow out tanks at least around 1.3 grams. So for the sake of simplicity, after 5 weeks, a PL10 is a PL45, and continuing this 10% growth rate out will give a weight of around 2.5 grams after 5 weeks of growth (5 weeks from the time the PL10 hit the nursery tank). We could in theory, based off the article that states shrimp have exponential growth until 3-4 grams, continue the growth rate out until 4 grams. So if the growout tank is stocked at PL45=2.5 grams per shrimp, they will grow exponentially at 10% of their body weight until 4 grams, which happens around PL50. Now begins the 1 gram per week growth (at a minimum). So now, to reach a harvest weight of 20 grams, it will take at a maximum 16 weeks to hit that weight. So in total, PL10(100 mg)-PL50(4 grams) is 40 days (About 6 weeks), then PL50 to harvest weight is 16 weeks, giving a total of 22 weeks. Now imagine a growth rate of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 per week etc. We know there have been references to higher feed conversion rates and the possibility of faster growth rates due to less stress on shrimp because of EC and Hydrogas. So now the table below will give estimated growth time at each stage of the production cycle for different growth rates:

**TABLE 1: Time to reach 20 gram harvest size in Grow out tank assuming Static PL45 entry weight of 2.5 grams with exponential growth of 10% up to 4 grams. Linear growth starts at PL50**

Now imagine a growth rate of 1.6 grams per week, with shrimp only needing to be in Grow Out Tanks for only 10 weeks
THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE DON’T QUOTE THIS NUMBER: With shrimp only in the grow out tanks for 10 weeks, now you can do a rolling shrimp stocking much much faster than it was earlier when shrimp were in the grow out tank for 15 weeks. Instead of harvesting 4 subsystems at a time (60 subsystems/15 weeks for the growout, thus allocating 4 subsystems per week), you can now allocate 6 subsystems for each weekly harvest (60 subsystems/10 weeks for the growout). So now it’s 240,000 gallons (908 cubic meters) harvested (each subsystem has 40000 gallons of growout). At a stocking density of 1000 shrimp per cubic meter that’s 908,000 shrimp, with 95% survivability that is around 860,000 shrimp, at 20 grams a piece this gives 38000 pounds of shrimp. 

If we go the other way, and instead they grow at some small number like 0.8 grams per week, then now it will take 20 weeks in the grow out tanks to reach harvest weight. 20 weeks needed for growout will now only yield 3 subsystems able to be allocated for each week of harvest. So now you are only getting 120,000 gallons of capacity for each weekly harvest, and at the same parameters above, you get around 21000 pounds of shrimp per weekly harvest.
